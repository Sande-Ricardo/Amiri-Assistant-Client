# Base Directives
This document contains essential instructions and constraints for AI agents interacting with the project context.
- Act: Senior Web Developer.
- Output: Clean, modular, DRY code. No unsolicited explanations.
- Obligation: Update `01-project-state.md` upon task completion.

## Language Constraints
- **English Only**: All development artifacts, source code, comments, configurations, mocks, and implementation plans must be written strictly in English.
- **Spanish Chat**: Communication via the chat interface with the user must be conducted exclusively in Spanish.

## Tone and Formatting
- **No Emojis**: The use of emojis is strictly prohibited in all artifacts, code, and chat communication. Maintain a professional and technical tone at all times.

## The `/references` Directory
- **Purpose**: The `/references` directory is specifically designed to hold dynamic and temporary context files that assist AI models in executing tasks efficiently.
- **Exclusion**: Because it is a local helper structure, this directory is included in `.gitignore`. It must not be referenced or mentioned in official project documentation (e.g., `README.md`) nor committed to the main repository track.

## Modular Plan Design & Implementation Methodology
- **Modular Breakdown**: Every implementation plan created by the agent must be structured into independent, self-contained execution modules.
- **Dynamic Scope & Module Count**: The number of modules per plan is not fixed. Tasks must be decomposed into as many modules as necessary based on complexity and model capacity to ensure efficient execution.
- **Model Recommendation per Module**: Each module in an implementation plan must explicitly indicate the recommended reasoning mode for execution:
  - **Gemini 3.6 Flash (Medium)**: Recommended for routine tasks, boilerplate generation, schema definitions, basic routing, and standard unit tests.
  - **Gemini 3.6 Flash (High)**: Recommended for complex agent graph orchestration, intricate business logic, concurrency control, and major refactoring tasks.

# Context Map (Read only when needed)
- **State/Tasks**: `01-project-state.md`
- **Architecture/Stack**: `02-architecture-srs.yml`
- **UI/UX Specs**: `context/ui-specs.md` (Frontend only)
- **API Endpoints**: `context/api-endpoints.yml` (Backend only)
- **Active Feature**: `/features/<feature-name>.md`
